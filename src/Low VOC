# Absorptive partitioning.

md"""
Kₒₘ is an equilibrium partition coefficient, which describes the partition between gas and aerosol phase for the compounds which can occurr in the form of particles and gases.
Naphtalene falls in the group of intermidiate volatile compounds in most of the cases which are more volatile than semivolatile intermidiate compounds. The partitioning between gas and aerosol phase can be calculated assuming pseudo-ideal solution and absorptive partitioning theory, which represents with the following equation:

Here we calculate Kₒₘ for semivolatile and intermediate volatile organic compounds, which represent by the following compounds: naphtalene, dibutyl phtalate, nanodecane. It corresponds to the equation #1 in the Pye et al. (2010).

Kₒₘ in m^3/ug is proportional to the gas constant, temperature, and reversely proportional to the molar mass, activity coefficient of the compound in aerosol phase, and partial vapor pressure. Here we calculate it using for loop for different temperatures. We can also plot it to see the relationship with the change of the temperature since the vapor pressure also changes with the temperature, the relationship is not that apparent. Now we can plot the equilibrium partition coefficient with the change of the temperature.

Since the partitioning in under the highly dilute conditions found in the atmosphere, is strongly influenced by the ambient temperature. The plot gives the dependance of equilibrium air partitioning coefficient with the temperature.

SVOCs from all sources are assumed to be emitted as two semivolatile surrogate species, SVOC1 and SVOC2, in roughly equal fractions of 0.49 and 0.51. Under most atmospherically relevant conditions, only the lower volatility component is expected to partition appreciably to the aerosol phase.

As we see by the plot the trends of Kₒₘ is pretty similar for all three species, with the bigger values for semivolatile organic compounds, which is consistent with the results of the paper. For the oxidation forms of the intermidiate volatile organic compounds (naphtalene used as a IVOC in the paper) increases significantly over the 10^9 times.

#The calculations provided help to understand the processes occurring in ambient atmosphere, equilibrium partitioning coefficient was calculated for different species with the dependence on temperature. It can be further used for modeling partition of low volatile compounds based on the data of the emissions of the low volatile compounds. However, GEOSChem model is already existing and was used in the Pye et al.(2010), but the estimates of the emissions and the contribution of each species is still not accurate enough, so more precise modeling could be conducted.

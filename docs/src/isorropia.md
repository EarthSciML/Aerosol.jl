# ISORROPIA

## Work in Progress

We are currently working on an implementation of ISORROPIA II, a thermodynamic equilibrium model for K⁺-Ca²⁺-Mg²⁺-NH₄⁺-Na⁺-SO₄²⁻-NO₃⁻-Cl⁻-H₂O aerosols, as described in:

This implementation is still a work in progress and is not yet available for use. Please check back later for updates.
